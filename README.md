# D3R_Data
This repository contains all necessary information in order to rerun the alchemical free energy simlations submitted for the D3R grand challenge 2015.

**Free-Energy** contains all input files for alchemical free energy calculations done. 

**Clustering** constains the scripts used for clustering PDB structures of HSP90.

**Docking input file are currently still missing.**

The publication *Blinded predictions of binding modes and energies of HSP90-α ligands for the 2015 D3R Grand Challenge*, by A.S.J.S. Mey, J. Juárez-Jiménez, A. Hennessy and J. Michel is currently under review.
